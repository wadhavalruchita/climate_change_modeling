The sun‚Äôs radiation basically passes through the oxygen and nitrogen in the earth‚Äôs atmosphere and lands on the earth‚Äôs surface, where 70% of it is absorbed; 30% is reflected back into the atmosphere. Part of this radiation bounces off the greenhouse gases and returns to be absorbed by earth. The greenhouses gases (GHGs) are water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (NO2) and methane (CH4).

How long does CO2 remain in the atmosphere? This is a difficult question because there are several processes that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. From 65% to 80% of the CO2 that is released into the air dissolves into the ocean over a period of 50-200 years. The rest is removed over several hundred thousand years. According to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, about 50% of CO2 increase will be removed from the atmosphere within 30 years, another 30% will be removed within a few centuries and the remaining 20% may stay in the atmosphere for thousands of years. This means that if we could stop carbon dioxide emissions tomorrow, the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would continue to warm the climate for thousands of years. Methane (CH4), by contrast, persists for about 12 years. Thus, even though methane is 26 times more potent than carbon dioxide, its effect is relatively short-lived. Furthermore, methane has increased from 700 ppb in 1750 to 1893 ppb today; notice that is parts per billion, not parts per million.

If the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere are causing global warming, how much will the earth warm up by the year 2100? This depends upon how many billions of tons of carbon dioxide are being emitted into the atmosphere. As a general rule, about 1 trillion tons of additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (actually 975 billion) will translate to about 125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide. Also, 125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide translates to about 1.8 ¬∞F (1 ¬∞C) in global warming. This can be verified by the fact that pre-industrial carbon dioxide was about 280 ppm and is now about 405 ppm. During this period, the planet warmed up about 1 ¬∞C.

Scientists have measured the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide which corresponds to 1 ppm and have found that this corresponds to 7.8 billion metric tons of CO2 in the atmosphere. Therefore, in order to increase the global temperature by 1 ¬∞C, you would need 125 x 7.8 billion or 975 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. A metric ton equals 1,000 kilograms (or 2.2 x 1,000 = 2,200 pounds); the U.S. is the only country in the world that does not use the metric ton. In 2016, the world pumped 36.1 billion metric tons (or 39.8 U.S. Gt) of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The average per capita emission of carbon dioxide is 7 metric tons per person per year. In the year 2100, there will be about 11 billion people. Therefore, in 2100, in a business-as-usual scenario, we can expect the world to emit 11 x 7 or 77 billion metric tons into the atmosphere per year or an average of 56.5 billion tons for the next 80 years, i.e., an accumulation of 4.52 trillion tons of CO2 by 2300.  Less 25% (1.13 Tt) due to carbon sinks (the oceans are almost saturated with CO2), the world will have an accumulation of 3.4Tt (4.52 ‚Äì 1.13) of carbon in the atmosphere. Dividing 3.4 trillion tons of CO2 by 975 million = 3.48 ¬∞C (6.26 ¬∞F).  This means that the world will be 6.26 ¬∞F warmer in 2100 than it was in 2020.

The rise in sea level comes from two distinct processes: water expansions (3.3 feet) due to the added 6.26 ¬∞F of increased temperature and melting ice, mainly from Greenland (.41 feet) and the Antarctica (.2 feet) or 3.91 total feet by 2100, as well as increased extraction of groundwater due to irrigation.   Although we do not usually notice it, water expands very slightly as it gets warmer. The second and potentially greater contribution to rising sea level comes from the melting of glacial ice. Antarctica has 90% of the ice, Greenland has 9% of the ice (2,931 trillion tons of ice) and the remaining 1% is tied up in continental glaciers, which except for the Himalayas will all melt by 2100.  If Greenland completely melts, it will raise the sea level by about 24 feet (7.2 meters).  If the Antarctica completely melts, it will add 200 feet (or 60 meters) to the sea level rise.   

In the year 2100, I predict that fossil fuels will be almost depleted (coal may last until 2150) and that the temperature rise will level off. My model predicts that Greenland will be losing about 500 Gt of ice per year until the end of the century, resulting in about 0.41 feet of sea level rise by 2100.  In addition, the Antarctica will add another 0.2 feet of sea level rise. Adding this to the 3.3 feet for thermal warming results in a sea level rise of 3.9 feet.  Now add 2 feet due to melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) due to the collapse of the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers and you have a 5.9 foot sea level rise by the end of the century.  NOAA (the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) states that the oceans could rise 8 feet by 2100 under a worse-case scenario, namely a complete collapse of the WAIS.  

What effect would a 5.9 foot sea level rise have on the U.S.? Miami is one of the most vulnerable places to rising seas. About 2 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded if sea levels rise just 3 feet. If the sea level rises 6 feet, 6 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded. A new study predicts that as many as 13.1 million Americans in coastal areas will have to relocate by 2100 if the sea level rises 5.9 feet (1.8 meters), which is what I expect to be the most likely scenario.

In addition to sea-level rise, global warming is contributing to increases in the spread of insect-borne illnesses and crop-damaging pests. For example, diseases such as Zika, dengue fever and chikungunya are transmitted by mosquitoes, which pick up these diseases by biting infected people and then spreading them to other people through subsequent bites. Research has shown that warmer temperatures shorten the incubation period, which means the disease can spread more rapidly. Warmer temperatures also tend to increase the geographic range of insects.

Global warming also translates into more extreme weather events because higher temperatures mean an increase in energy in the atmosphere and oceans; energy is what drives weather. While we cannot attribute any particular storm to global warming, we can tie an overall trend to global warming. It makes logical sense that warm ocean waters give birth to more intense weather. Generally, hurricanes cannot survive for long over sea surfaces that are cooler than about 79 ¬∞F (26 ¬∞C). The longer the ocean waters stay above 79 ¬∞F, the more opportunity there is for a hurricane to blossom.

Lastly, global warming will result in more droughts, floods and water scarcity.  Demand for water has tripled during the past 50 years. Currently a half billion people live in a water-stressed country. By 2025, that number is expected to increase to about 3 billion. The vast majority of fresh water, about 70%, is used for agriculture. On the U.S. East Coast, much of the water supply comes from surface water, whereas most of the Midwest gets its water supply from a combination of surface waters and well water. The well water comes from underground aquifers such as the Ogallala Aquifer. At present rates of withdrawal, parts of the Ogallala Aquifer water will be available for irrigation for only another 10 to 20 years."

This is Not a permanent fix. Only a delaying action.  
Can someone Calculate how big a 
Solid object 
Spaced apart panels
would have to be to have a 1 degree effect etc.?

Would any benefits come from this?
Adjustable Tint 
Change UV output / polarization for earth plantlife benefits
Change Output Color for plantlife Benefits? 

Thanks for any help or info on this matter"

Maybe this will not change the amount of emissions in atmosphere from 10 yrs ago,but if earth got that rest 1 day a week it will absolutely rejuvenate all that is being used and needed for earth to be more efficient and effective. Stop experimenting with so much uncertainty that is potentially more destructive and jwork on promoting the world to give earth off on Sundays and shut it off! Maybe the results would be miraculous and would heal this planet quicker than we‚Äôd ever imagine. We will never know until it‚Äôs done. Make that your great experiment to save the planet.

The air in a greenhouse is heated by solar radiation, an increase in solar radiation temperature would also increase temperature. If the temperature outside the earth's atmosphere is above the boiling point of water (approx. 120¬∞C), is it not possible that an increase could affect the atmosphere. Also, heated cosmic radiation could affect the temperature. What comes to mind is the 'P' theory. In an outdoor public unheated pool, you come along a warm spot of water. (We all know what that means.) The solar system could be traveling through such a heated radiation cloud. The Milky Way galaxy has chaotic catastrophic events of stellar birth, life and death throughout. Clouds or jets of superheated radiation blasted into space. Well, we might be entering that space. But, closer to home, one just has to look at a frosted window, on a winter morning, as the light from the sun hits it. With temperatures below freezing, the sun's rays melts the frost.

But how?  Why does the climate change?  

It‚Äôs not magic. 

The climate changes because the Earth‚Äôs orbit varies - it isn‚Äôt a perfect oval. No planet‚Äôs orbit is perfect. 

The tiny bit of change in our orbit means we get slightly more warmth from the sun during one phase and slightly less during the other. Just a tiny amount. 

The variation in orbit is called the Milankovitch Cycle. 

Does having a little more or less sun cause ice ages and warm spells?  Not on its own.

But when the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere warms just a smidge, the oceans warm up. And as they warm they release carbon dioxide.  When they cool down, they absorb carbon dioxide. 

It‚Äôs just the nature of gases - they‚Äôre absorbed into cool water and released when water warms up. Think about a pot of boiling water releasing bubbles.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) traps heat. So as the CO2 level in the air rises, the atmospheric temperature increases.  Which causes more CO2 to be released by the oceans.  Which raises the temperature some more. 

It‚Äôs a positive feedback loop.  

When our orbit is in the cooler phase the temperature falls and the CO2 level slowly goes back down.  Cooling off takes longer than warming up. 

During ice ages, the CO2 level was 180 parts per million (ppm) and during warm spells, the CO2 has been 280 ppm.
It‚Äôs been a  consistent system for 800,000 years. Heats up, cools very slowly. 180-280 ppm, back and forth. 

The problem is‚Ä¶for 150 years we‚Äôve been digging up fossil fuels and burning them, adding CO2 to the atmosphere. Gigatons of CO2. Every year. 

So the CO2 level in the atmosphere is now over 400ppm.  

More carbon dioxide traps more heat -  like throwing another blanket on your bed.  

And climate change is causing more climate change. 

As the permafrost in Siberia thaws, gigatons of methane gas are being released. Methane traps 30 times more heat than CO2. 

Once-frozen Siberia has been burning, which releases more CO2. 

Melting glaciers mean the Earth loses reflectivity and absorbs more heat. Which causes more melting."

They have the power to meet the needs of displaced peoples who‚Äôs lives are destroyed by climate change, or leave them to die. 

A cursory look at even just our recent history of dealing with environmental disasters and displaced people (Katrina, Puerto Rico, these fires, the migrant ‚Äòcrises‚Äô on the borders of Mexico, in the Mediterranean, etc) shows what decisions they will make. 

It‚Äôs not because they are uniquely evil people. It‚Äôs because of the logic of capital. They have an incentive, a near obligation, to maintain growth, maintain their bottom line. 

To fight climate change, we need to fight this apocalyptic class. As workers, people who every day reproduce the world around us, who have the power to change the world, we have the weapon of withholding  our labor to force capital to bend to our will (which, I imagine, would include not allowing the world to burn, destroying all of our and our loved ones futures).

Only when we work together, organize in our neighborhoods, workplaces, etc, will we have the power to challenge the system that is killing us.

Join a union. Join a socialist organization. Fight back in the streets. Read Lenin (and anyone else you think could help arm you with theory). We have to take this seriously if we are to have a future at all. "

NASA wants you to believe that man is the sole reason temperature increases. to be sure their own graphs when a thinking cap is put on shows most of the increase is well before man's influence. They also promote wild sea level increases, but again look at the sea level graph with your thinking cap on. Again the WILD rise was way before man was influencing anything here on earth. My point being carbon isn't poison man has flourished the most during the warm periods. Man isn't causing the flooding from rising seal levels that is natural, at most man can influence the speed of an occurrence. We need to find alternative energy sources because we need energy, cheap energy sources. Cheap energy saves lives on this earth, expensive energy kills people. We can prepare for changing climate but we cannot use energy we cannot afford to use. We need causes to save ourselves, for instance did you know the Big coastal cities most run by Democrats while telling you you need to pay the green shaman to make your weather better and safer for you, they are still dumping their poisons into the ocean because it is cheaper than disposing of them properly on land? Out of sight out of mind except you and I both know this is poisoning our oceans. While they tell us coral reefs dying are caused by your use of energy and that red tides are from a mysterious origin, they dump chemicals into our oceans without one acknowledgement of the damage this is doing! You know dumping in our oceans is wrong right? Where is the plastic coming from? Oh yeah straws which by the way are never found in the ocean are the cause not at all from their ocean dumped garbage starting to unravel. 

Think! Cheap energy and as important universal access to it is a human right, those that control our access to energy control us! Demand cheap energy to save Black Lives, demand ocean dumping STOP to save Black Lives!!!!!!!!!!! 

Stop the idiocy! 

We can do this!

The climate change hoax has collapsed. A devastating series of research papers has just been published, revealing that human activity can account for no more than a .01¬∞C rise in global temperatures, meaning that all the human activity targeted by radical climate change alarmists ‚Äî combustion engines, airplane flights, diesel tractors ‚Äî has virtually no measurable impact on the temperature of the planet.

Finnish scientists spearheaded the research, releasing a paper entitled, ‚ÄúNo Experimental Evidence for the Significant Anthropogenic Climate Change.‚Äù

This is further supported by researchers at Kobe University in Japan who published a nearly simultaneous paper that reveals how changes in our planet‚Äôs magnetic field govern the intensity of solar radiation that reaches the lower atmosphere, causing cloud formation that alters global temperatures.hat study, published in Nature, is called, ‚ÄúIntensified East Asian winter monsoon during the last geomagnetic reversal transition.‚Äù"

The sun‚Äôs radiation basically passes through the oxygen and nitrogen in the earth‚Äôs atmosphere and lands on the earth‚Äôs surface, where 70% of it is absorbed; 30% is reflected back into the atmosphere. Part of this radiation bounces off the greenhouse gases and returns to be absorbed by earth. The greenhouses gases (GHGs) are water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (NO2) and methane (CH4).

How long does CO2 remain in the atmosphere? This is a difficult question because there are several processes that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. From 65% to 80% of the CO2 that is released into the air dissolves into the ocean over a period of 50-200 years. The rest is removed over several hundred thousand years. According to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, about 50% of CO2 increase will be removed from the atmosphere within 30 years, another 30% will be removed within a few centuries and the remaining 20% may stay in the atmosphere for thousands of years. This means that if we could stop carbon dioxide emissions tomorrow, the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would continue to warm the climate for thousands of years. Methane (CH4), by contrast, persists for about 12 years. Thus, even though methane is 26 times more potent than carbon dioxide, its effect is relatively short-lived. Furthermore, methane has increased from 700 ppb in 1750 to 1893 ppb today; notice that is parts per billion, not parts per million.

If the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere are causing global warming, how much will the earth warm up by the year 2100? This depends upon how many billions of tons of carbon dioxide are being emitted into the atmosphere. As a general rule, about 1 trillion tons of additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (actually 975 billion) will translate to about 125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide. Also, 125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide translates to about 1.8 ¬∞F (1 ¬∞C) in global warming. This can be verified by the fact that pre-industrial carbon dioxide was about 280 ppm and is now about 405 ppm. During this period, the planet warmed up about 1 ¬∞C.

Scientists have measured the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide which corresponds to 1 ppm and have found that this corresponds to 7.8 billion metric tons of CO2 in the atmosphere. Therefore, in order to increase the global temperature by 1 ¬∞C, you would need 125 x 7.8 billion or 975 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. A metric ton equals 1,000 kilograms (or 2.2 x 1,000 = 2,200 pounds); the U.S. is the only country in the world that does not use the metric ton. In 2016, the world pumped 36.1 billion metric tons (or 39.8 U.S. Gt) of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The average per capita emission of carbon dioxide is 7 metric tons per person per year. In the year 2100, there will be about 11 billion people. Therefore, in 2100, in a business-as-usual scenario, we can expect the world to emit 11 x 7 or 77 billion metric tons into the atmosphere per year or an average of 56.5 billion tons for the next 80 years, i.e., an accumulation of 4.52 trillion tons of CO2 by 2300.  Less 25% (1.13 Tt) due to carbon sinks (the oceans are almost saturated with CO2), the world will have an accumulation of 3.4Tt (4.52 ‚Äì 1.13) of carbon in the atmosphere. Dividing 3.4 trillion tons of CO2 by 975 million = 3.48 ¬∞C (6.26 ¬∞F).  This means that the world will be 6.26 ¬∞F warmer in 2100 than it was in 2020.

The rise in sea level comes from two distinct processes: water expansions (3.3 feet) due to the added 6.26 ¬∞F of increased temperature and melting ice, mainly from Greenland (.41 feet) and the Antarctica (.2 feet) or 3.91 total feet by 2100, as well as increased extraction of groundwater due to irrigation.   Although we do not usually notice it, water expands very slightly as it gets warmer. The second and potentially greater contribution to rising sea level comes from the melting of glacial ice. Antarctica has 90% of the ice, Greenland has 9% of the ice (2,931 trillion tons of ice) and the remaining 1% is tied up in continental glaciers, which except for the Himalayas will all melt by 2100.  If Greenland completely melts, it will raise the sea level by about 24 feet (7.2 meters).  If the Antarctica completely melts, it will add 200 feet (or 60 meters) to the sea level rise.   

In the year 2100, I predict that fossil fuels will be almost depleted (coal may last until 2150) and that the temperature rise will level off. My model predicts that Greenland will be losing about 500 Gt of ice per year until the end of the century, resulting in about 0.41 feet of sea level rise by 2100.  In addition, the Antarctica will add another 0.2 feet of sea level rise. Adding this to the 3.3 feet for thermal warming results in a sea level rise of 3.9 feet.  Now add 2 feet due to melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) due to the collapse of the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers and you have a 5.9 foot sea level rise by the end of the century.  NOAA (the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) states that the oceans could rise 8 feet by 2100 under a worse-case scenario, namely a complete collapse of the WAIS.  

What effect would a 5.9 foot sea level rise have on the U.S.? Miami is one of the most vulnerable places to rising seas. About 2 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded if sea levels rise just 3 feet. If the sea level rises 6 feet, 6 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded. A new study predicts that as many as 13.1 million Americans in coastal areas will have to relocate by 2100 if the sea level rises 5.9 feet (1.8 meters), which is what I expect to be the most likely scenario.

In addition to sea-level rise, global warming is contributing to increases in the spread of insect-borne illnesses and crop-damaging pests. For example, diseases such as Zika, dengue fever and chikungunya are transmitted by mosquitoes, which pick up these diseases by biting infected people and then spreading them to other people through subsequent bites. Research has shown that warmer temperatures shorten the incubation period, which means the disease can spread more rapidly. Warmer temperatures also tend to increase the geographic range of insects.

Global warming also translates into more extreme weather events because higher temperatures mean an increase in energy in the atmosphere and oceans; energy is what drives weather. While we cannot attribute any particular storm to global warming, we can tie an overall trend to global warming. It makes logical sense that warm ocean waters give birth to more intense weather. Generally, hurricanes cannot survive for long over sea surfaces that are cooler than about 79 ¬∞F (26 ¬∞C). The longer the ocean waters stay above 79 ¬∞F, the more opportunity there is for a hurricane to blossom.

Lastly, global warming will result in more droughts, floods and water scarcity.  Demand for water has tripled during the past 50 years. Currently a half billion people live in a water-stressed country. By 2025, that number is expected to increase to about 3 billion. The vast majority of fresh water, about 70%, is used for agriculture. On the U.S. East Coast, much of the water supply comes from surface water, whereas most of the Midwest gets its water supply from a combination of surface waters and well water.

Carbon dioxide has little or nothing to do with global warming. CO2 Is currently traced at 400 ppm. That is one carbon-dioxide molecule for every 2500 parts of the atmosphere. Humans contribute only a scant 16 ppm, which is 4% of the total CO2 accumulated in a year. CO2 only holds heat for a few seconds, and there is not enough of it to drive climate change. It is thermodynamically impossible!
Also, bear in mind, that water vapor is the earth's most abundant and effective Greenhouse Gas. CO2 is only 5% of the earth's CHG. Water vapor is 95% of the earth's GHG and holds heat far longer than CO2.
Lastly, CO2 will increase only after temperatures rise (eg. El Nino) and oceans degas. Conversely, CO2 levels drop as temperatures cool. In other words, CO2 levels are influenced by heat or the lack thereof and therefore do not drive climate but follow climate.
Clearly, CO2 is actually a thermometer and not a thermostat!"
